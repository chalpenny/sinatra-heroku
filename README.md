Welcome to your handy dandy vehicle maintenance tracker.

This great app will help you easily track dates, costs, and services performed on your vehicles(s) to provide an easy reference for you.

Never forget when the last time you got your oil changed was again!

To start, sign up with an email and password.  Then add a vehicle with some basic info.  After that, just log in each time you have a service or maintenance performed on your vehicle, quickly log the info, and reference whenever you need!

Thanks for using my app!  I hope you find it to be very useful.

Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'sinatra-heroku'
